# FWI Prediction


## About

FWI Prediction is a prediction model that utilizes Ridge regression to forecast the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for the Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes regions in Algeria. The FWI serves as a crucial metric for assessing fire danger, offering insights into the probability of forest fires based on prevailing weather conditions.

## Features

- Utilizes Ridge regression for FWI prediction.
- Incorporates various weather factors and FWI components, including:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Rainfall
  - Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)
  - Duff Moisture Code (DMC)
  - Drought Code (DC)
  - Initial Spread Index (ISI)
  - Buildup Index (BUI)
